# Snippets and Templates Library

Code templates and other snippets that I often find myself needing to
source or paste. Organization is based on Vim file type (which is why
things like markdown are listed as `pandoc` here since I use a plugin
that creates that file type). I use them with a `snip` script. Your
mileage may vary.
